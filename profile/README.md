## Mission

We built tools that make crypto easier to use.

## Team

The Atomize team was co-founded by [Joe Blau](https://twitter.com/joeblau) and [Johad Ellis](https://twitter.com/johadellis). They met each other working on Self-Driving cars with Uber where Joe was a software engineer and Johad was a designer on the Human Experience Team. Both of them were captivated by the promise of financial freedom and digital sovereignty of crypto. Now, they want to make crypto products more accessible following the [first principles of crypto](https://twitter.com/mrJackLevin/status/1558467164360695809).
